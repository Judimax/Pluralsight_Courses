## Sample Introduction Demo
INTRODUCTION

On January 17, 2014, one of our salespeople experienced catastrophic computer failure at his
workstation PC, which critically damaged the hard drive and erased all of its information. The employee
was not at fault for the computer failure; failure can simply be attributed to degradation of moving parts
within the fixed hard drive itself. Rebuildingthe machine was fairly straightforward; recreating the data, however, was much more complicated. The hard drive contained a great deal of mission critical data
including loan amounts, client information, data about special projects (like in-progress promotional
work for our upcoming benefit dinner) and account information. Recreating client and account data
from printed records, cell phone contacts, and voicemails took approximately twenty-four work hours,
though the employees certain that (in his words) he “just has to be missing someone.” Work on special
projects is irretrievable, and as of this writing has yet to be recreated.
Since the employee's loan records and applicant profiles are now patchy, and he remains unclear about
much of what he actually lost, the financial value of the lost data is difficult to calculate and may remain so. More immediately, though, this incident represents a larger issue at our organization: the lack of a
sustained, standardized data backup plan or protocol.

Right now, organization policy states that individual employees are responsible for duplicating their own
data. However, we don't put people in a position to know how to do this within their own operating
environments, and many employees lack the perspective or technical knowledge to back up data
consistently or reliably. Furthermore, this “whenever we think about it” attitude towards data storage
on the part of individual employees arguably reflects our larger attitude as an organization. We have no
system or pattern regarding when we back up our data, and our mission critical information often has a
single point of failure, meaning that if it is ever corrupted or lost, it cannot be recreated or retrieved (as our recent experience shows).
* Establishes this employee's situation as typical of the larger workforce
* Describes how current policy and protocol creates this situation

These facts are alarming since data is vulnerable to loss in many ways:
® Mechanical hard drive failure
e Theft of workstation terminals (including our five laptops, which are especially vulnerable)
e Environmental catastrophe like flood, fire, or electrical surge
e Operator error (accidentally deleting a file, for example)
® Intentional data loss via a security breach
Any one of the above incidents could be catastrophic to our organization. We are a data critical
company, and without our client records, loan information, and donor records we cannot function.
Furthermore, the brave men and women who we've made it our mission to help would be subsequently
impacted by our lost productivity and uncertainty about our data. Finally, as a 501c3 organization we are
ethically and legally obligated to maintain accurate records of donor funds, and to furnish this
information upon request. An inability to do so would violate our status as a tax-free organization, and
possibly be grounds for that designation being revoked.

* Starts with logical appeal to establish range of problem
* Makes emotional appeal to engage readers personally
* Identifies specific greater need

In short, we need to solve our data storage problem. Specifically, two kinds of data backup need to be
addressed: incremental backup (for files that change regularly) and long-term storage backup (for files,
media, and system images we don't want to discard, but that we don't revise or access as routinely as
our active documents).

In order to protect against future data loss, | propose implementing a standardized, companywide data
backup plan. This will involve four tasks: automating backup at the workstation level, purchasing
additional network accessible storage (NAS) to be housed on site as a safeguard against immediate
damage, setting up a schedule and protocol by which we manage long term data storage, and adding an
additional level of cloud based, virtual storage for archived system images and critical information.

The rest of this document details my proposed plan, gives a preliminary budget, discusses a timeline for
implementation, establishes my qualifications, and provides some final thoughts.

![alt text](images/image-18.png)
![alt text](images/image-19.png)

![alt text](images/image-20.png)
concrete steps not abstract goal


## Sample Proposed Tasks Demo
### TASK ONE:
Automate Backup at
the Workstation Level

* AUTOMATE WORKSTATION BACKUPS TO OUR OWN
NETWORK

An ideal option involves automating the backup
process through the administration of our own
individual network.

This would centralize the storage on a company level
and increase point of failure redundancy. As mentioned
above, we need to be concerned about back up data
both on the level of individual files and on the level of
full system images.
* Automating Backup Involves Several Things

“Using the shadow copy service available via Windows
Server 2008 (the operating system that currently
manages our existing server). “

Automated at off-peak times

Version control, meaning users can fix undesired
changes Automatically deletes oldest backups when
storage fills up

“sending out a memo to make sure that users are storing
their data on a network drive”

Create system images “using the Backup and Restore
Utility within the Windows 7 operating environment.”
Operates at off-peak hours

Separates file backups and system images



### TASK TWO:
Reconfigure current
Incremental storage

using a Network
Attached Storage
(NAS) server

In addition to routinely collecting system and data backups,
it is important to store them in a way that ensures they are
reliable and permanent. Taking this step will involve
purchasing a dedicated data backup server providing
Network Attached Storage (NAS) whose primary role will
be to house system information across multiple hard drives
using a redundant array of independent disks (RAID).

There are many ways to set up RAID storage, but |
recommend using a RAID 5 configuration, which will use
disk parity to distribute data across multiple drives.
Consequently, if one drive fails the data of the drive can be
reconstructed based on the data replicated elsewhere.

* There are a variety of NAS servers on the market,
each with their own value and features. If the
board of directors authorizes this proposal, | will
research the top models and brands further and
prepare a recommendation report on the specific
NAS server that will best meet our needs.


### TASK THREE:

Set up a protocol to
manage long term
data storage

* Right now, system wide data (in addition to being
saved irregularly) is also deleted irregularly. This
means we are currently wasting storage space
with redundant data. Consequently, we advocate
establishing a system of managing and
strategically deleting redundant backups, using
the following protocol:

(1)Once a week, we will automatically delete all daily
backups except for the Friday backup.

(2)Once a month, we will automatically delete all
Friday backups except for the most recent Friday.

(3)Once a quarter, we will automatically delete all
monthly backups except for the most recent month.

### TASK FOUR:
Set up virtual, cloud
based storage to
provide off-site
redundancy

* The locally housed server will provide us with ample data storage and
data redundancy for our in-house workstations. However, a locally
stored server is still vulnerable to environmental disaster (such as a fire
or flood) or malicious action such as theft. In order to ensure that our
data has long-term integrity, | recommend we select an option for long-
term virtual storage, which will store limited data off-site as additional
insurance against the unlikely event of a catastrophe.

In this virtual location, we will store our quarterly backups of system
images, as well as a weekly copy of our donor and lending databases,
which contain records of our collected income and disbursed funds.

This will ensure that we are preserving the most critical dimensions of
our business.
There are many options for obtaining virtual storage, the most
direct of which involves leasing it from an existing data storage
company. If the board of directors approves this proposal, | will
investigate the options and pick one with appropriate security
measures and a reasonable pedigree, to ensure that the
company (and therefore our data) will be around as long as
needed, and minimize the risk of losing our data due to another
company shuttering operations.

In effect, using virtual storage will enable us to have backups of
the backups, an additional layer of insurance in a worst case
scenario.

### TASK FIVE:
Conduct a Data
Recovery Simulation

* Once we have a system of localized storage in
place, we should conduct a data recovery
simulation to ensure that backups are being
appropriately managed and are retrievable. This
process will involve picking ten files at random
from throughout the company, and then
attempting to retrieve this data from the backups.

I will conduct these simulations once a month to
make sure the system is functioning optimally, and
then make any adjustments as appropriate.

## The Conclusion Section

* unsolicited proposal
Over the past few years, this company has grown from a
handful of accounts and employees to a staff of twenty-five
and a database of hundreds of donors and veterans. In the
early days, we could afford to back up data using local
storage or external hard drives. As we've grown, however, so
has the complexity and value of our data.

In a way, we were fortunate with our recent instance of data
loss; we recovered the majority of the data, if not the work,
and did not lose anything that irretrievably crippled our ability
to do business. The incident was, however, a wake-up call. In
order to prepare for the worst situations, we must invest in the
best practices. In the short term, that means developing a
data back-up protocol that is consistent, effective, and—most
importantly—reliable.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

On January 17, 2014, one of our employees experiences a hard drive failure at
his terminal, resulting in the unrecoverable loss of the drive itself and all
associated data. While the failure of the computer was inconvenient, the loss
of the data was catastrophic, and included work on special projects and
client information (including loan history and contact information) among
other mission critical data. Loss of this information will ultimately take a
financial toll that is difficult to calculate at present. In order to protect
against future data loss, | propose implementing a standardized,
companywide data backup plan. This will involving automating backup at the
workstation level, purchasing additional network attached storage (NAS) to
be housed on site as a safeguard against immediate damage, setting up a
schedule and protocol by which we manage long term data storage, and
adding an additional level of off-site, cloud based storage for archived
system images and critical information. The total cost associated with this
project is $1,200 for start-up costs, as well as $15 a month for cloud-based
storage. | can have this system up and running within two weeks.
